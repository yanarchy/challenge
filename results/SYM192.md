```js
// Write a function called billTotal that calculates the total to be paid at a restaurant -- including tip and tax -- given the subtotal (i.e. cost of food and drinks).

 //The tip will be 20% and tax will be 8%
function billTotal(food, drinks) {
	var tax = 0;
	var tip = 0;

	tax = 8 %  (food + drinks);
	tip = 20 % (food + drinks);


	return food + drinks + tax + tip;
