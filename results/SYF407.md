Please study if-statements, for-loops and while-loops more!

I think you need to practice doing more loops. Please contact me when you are free: yan@rbk.org

Functions Completed: 5/6

## billTotal
Wrong answer. Please check! Do you need a while loop there?

## animalNoise
Are you sure you need a for loop there? Do you mean an if-statement? Doesn't work.

## digitalSum
Incorrect. What does a for-loop look like? What does a while-loop look like?

## fib
Same issues.

## fizzBuzzTwo
Did not attempt.

## factorial
Same issues.

## Overall Score: 1
